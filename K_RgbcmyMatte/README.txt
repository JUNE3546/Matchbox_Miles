### K_RgbcmyMatte

Hi! This is a Matchbox shader downloaded from http://logik-matchbook.org

### Installation

This package includes a file called INSTALL.command

On OS X its sufficient to simply double-click that file. A Terminal window will open
and will prompt you for your admin password. Once entered, the shaders will be copied
into your Autodesk matchbox directories and will be available to you everytime you
open a fresh Matchbox node.

On Linux, run this file as a shell script, to the same effect:

   ./INSTALL.command
